  - I'm King Renard's royal courier, here to deliver a message to your liege lord.
  - I see, your arrival was expected courier. Open the gates!
  - Appreciated guard.
  - Halt! Who goes there?
  - Oh, you must be the courier my uncle sent.
  - What news do you bear, do tell.
  - Thank you for having me  in your halls my lord.
  - His majesty King Renard demands you pay the fealty of 5000 lejors at once!
  - You may take your leave now, safe journeys.
  - Thank you my lord, farewell.
  - Greetings, my Lord Philippe, warden of the east and lord paramount of Arevignet.
  - Your cousin, his royal majesties, King Renard II sends his regards.
  - As per your annual tribute to the crown.
  - As kind as he ever was. But I imagine he sent you here for a reason.
  - The annual tribute of my region, which shall be delivered soon, as it's always
    been.
  - I see, it seems my cousin haven't taught any manners to you.
  - Anyway, the tribute of my region will be sent in due time as always.
  - Very happy to hear that my lord.
  - Anything else, lad?
  - There may be a thing or two, but first I'll take a gander here, sir.
  - How goes your region, my lord?
  - Have you sighted anything odd, anything you'd want me to report to his majesty?
  - How goes? Splendid of course! Is there any doubt at my cousin's court?
  - None that I know of, sir. His grace always spoke highly of you.
  - Good. All is well here, courier. Our churches are open and prayer halls are filled.
  - Peculiar? What nonsense. Everything is perfectly fine in here! Have you seen
    something?
  - I've met a lady in the woods, she was running away from your keep.
  - No my lord, all seems fine in your region.
  - Fine, you have my leave. Return to me if you must tell anything else.
  - We even have a new preacher, trained by Lord Weigar himself!
  - No my lord, I'm all set.
  - What! How did... okay, listen to me very carefully now.
  - I do not know what you think you saw, but none of that will be spoken outside
    these walls.
  - Otherwise... well, let's not go there, shall we?
  - Indeed so! My region has only thrived under my rule.
  - His grace will be happy to hear that, my lord.
  - Could've been worse?
  - Err, excuse me?
  - Never you mind. I was an archer once, fought in the war of succession.
  - I'm sure everyone is thankful for your services to your kingdom.
  - Oh sure... my dad specially. He's up there contemplating why I didn't die in
    the field
  - and instead came home as a jobless, useless leech to him. Why am I even telling
    these to you...
  - Well I'm King Renard's courier, perhaps there somethi...
  - Yuck! Should've known from the fancy robes... what good could a court jester
    do me... bugger off!
  - Piss off, will ya!
  - Everything...
  - What's wrong kid?
  - Perhaps your parents can help with it? Where are they?
  - You can tell me about it if you want, I'm the king's courier.
  - That's the thing... they're gone, both of them.
  - You! You're the courier!? Just leave me alone!
  - Go away, I won't talk to you!
  - Hey
  - How many times do I have to tell you Richard,
  - Prayer nights aren't negotiable!
  - But mummy...
  - Richard! I don't know what's gotten into you since your papa left!
  - While he's defending our way of life all the way in foreign lands, you're attempting
    to abandon our faith.
  - I heard the kids talking about the new preacher, he's not a good man ma...
  - Shush! No more of that none sense! He is a kind and honest man with noble intentions.
  - Do you mind, sir! I'm tyring to discipline my son in here!
  - Right, I'm sorry ma'am
  - Hey there, you look like you could use a drink.
  - Oh, no thanks, I'm on duty.
  - Oooh, right. Apologies your lordship majesty...
  - That's not how... anyway, good night to you miss.
  - Are you still here... whatever for, just leave me be.
  - Alright...
  - I'm trying to pray, go away!
  - Go, begone I say!
  - The ever-watchful Greitha shall spare me from the horrors of that place.
  - You need to talk to my Captain if you seek entry.
  - He's literally standing right over there...
  - Well, the gates are open for you, you want an invitation or something.
  - What in the hells!
  - '*Stone resonates in silence*'
  - Right, you're probably wondering why a half naked man is waving at you...
  - Well much like this guy, this game is far from being fully covered.
  - But thank you for taking your time to go through what I've got so far. I hope
    you've found something to enjoy.
  - Since there's much ground to cover before this game is ready to be shared with
    a broader audience,
  - I can only hope that it was, in some way, a promising experience even if not
    a very immersive one yet.
  - Once again, thank you and have a lovely day.
  - No but for real, leave. Click the exit button.
  - It just over there on the top left corner, byee!
  - A lady in red ran outside the gates just now...
  - She must have thought the woods would be better than here.
  - Hey, I think a lady just ran out these gates, where is she?
  - What lady? You ask too many questions you now...
  - Just mind your own business and stay out of trouble, courier.
