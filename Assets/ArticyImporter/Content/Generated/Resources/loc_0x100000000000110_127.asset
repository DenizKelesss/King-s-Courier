  - Halt by the name of King Harlach!
  - I'm King Harlach's royal courier, here to deliver a message to your liege lord.
  - Your arrival was expected courier. Open the gates!
  - Appreciated guard, thank you!
  - Who goes there?
  - Oh, you must be the courier my uncle sent.
  - What news do you bear, do tell.
  - Thank you for having me  in your halls my lord.
  - His majesty King Renard demands you pay the fealty of 5000 lejors at once!
  - It's my duty to host the King's envoy.
  - Farewell, my lord.
  - Everything...
  - What's wrong kid?
  - You can tell me about it if you want, I'm the king's courier.
  - Perhaps your parents can help with it? Where are they?
  - You! You're the courier!? Just leave me alone!
  - That's the thing... they're gone, both of them.
  - Go away, I won't talk to you!
  - Hey
  - Fuck my life...
  - Everything...
  - What's wrong kid?

  - Go away, I won't talk to you!
  - Hey
  - How many times do I have to tell you Richard,
  - Prayer nights aren't negotiable!
  - But mummy...
  - No buts, Richard! I don't know what's gotten into you since your papa left!
  - While he's defending our way of life all the way in Raspedia, you're attempting
    to abandon our faith.
  - I heard the kids talking about Proctor Lewis, he's not a good man ma...
  - Shush! No more of that none sense! Proctor is a kind and noble man who means
    for the good of us all.
  - Hey there hot stuff
  - I'm trying to pray, go away!
  - Go, begone I say!
